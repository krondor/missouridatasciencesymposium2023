It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Creating an access token from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining a Python class for calling the WML Foundation Model inferencing API\n* Using the class to generate output from a provided text input\n\n# Setup\n\n## Inferencing class\nThis cell defines a class that makes a REST API call to the watsonx Foundation Model\ninferencing API that we will use to generate output from the provided input.\nThe class takes the access token created in the previous step, and uses it to\nmake a REST API call with input, model id and model parameters. The response\nfrom the API call is returned as the cell output."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":"import requests\n\nclass Prompt:\n    def __init__(self, access_token, project_id):\n        self.access_token = access_token\n        self.project_id = project_id\n\n    def generate(self, input, model_id, parameters):\n        wml_url = \"https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v1-beta/generation/text?version=2023-05-28\"\n        Headers = {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + self.access_token,\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\n        }\n        data = {\n            \"model_id\": model_id,\n            \"input\": input,\n            \"parameters\": parameters,\n            \"project_id\": self.project_id\n        }\n        response = requests.post(wml_url, json=data, headers=Headers)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return response.json()[\"results\"][0][\"generated_text\"]\n        else:\n            return response.text","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## watsonx API connection\nThis cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation\nModel inferencing.\n\n**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud personal API key.

Read the document and then write a short 1 paragraph summary.\n\nDocument:\n\nA Message from the Director\n\nWelcome to University of Missouri Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI) web site!  MUIDSI is an interdisciplinary research and graduate education program offering a PhD in Informatics and an MS in Data Science & Analytics. Trainees have the option to choose bioinformatics, biomedical/health informatics, or geoinformatics emphasis areas for their PhD studies. The MS in Data Science and Analytics program offers several emphasis areas for both executive/on-line and on-campus programs. Managed and supported by the Vice Chancellor for Research Office and the Graduate School, the Institute has more than 60 core faculty members from 8 colleges/schools mentoring 120 graduate students. Among the current student body, 42 PhD students are sponsored by extramural funding, training grants, industry sponsorships, etc.  Incoming PhD students are encouraged to also pursue an MS degree in Data Science & Analytics as part of their PhD training.\n\nOur Informatics PhD students come from a wide spectrum of academic backgrounds, such as physicians, nurses, computer scientists, data scientists, biologists, chemists, statisticians, engineers, social scientists, etc. In addition, the MD-PhD Informatics program was just launched in 2020 to recruit prospective medical students.\n\nOur MS in Data Science and Analytics (DSA) program offers state-of-the-art Big Data Analytics training for working professionals and residential students for career advancement to secure data scientist positions in various sectors.  Our current emphasis areas include Geospatial Analytics, Biohealth Analytics, Data Journalism/Strategic Communication, High Performance Computing, and Human-Centered Data Design.  The online MS DSA program received the 2018 University Professional and Continuing Education Association (UPCEA) Central Region Outstanding Credit Program Award and ranked #7 on Fortune’s Best Online Master’s in Data Science Programs in 2022.\n\nIf you are a prospective student, please feel free to contact me and our leadership/administrative team for more information on the application process.
