It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: [Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook](/docs).\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.\n\n## Notebook goals\nThe learning goals of this notebook are:\n\n* Creating an access token from the IBM Cloud personal API key\n* Defining a Python class for calling the WML Foundation Model inferencing API\n* Using the class to generate output from a provided text input\n\n# Setup\n\n## Inferencing class\nThis cell defines a class that makes a REST API call to the watsonx Foundation Model\ninferencing API that we will use to generate output from the provided input.\nThe class takes the access token created in the previous step, and uses it to\nmake a REST API call with input, model id and model parameters. The response\nfrom the API call is returned as the cell output."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":"import requests\n\nclass Prompt:\n    def __init__(self, access_token, project_id):\n        self.access_token = access_token\n        self.project_id = project_id\n\n    def generate(self, input, model_id, parameters):\n        wml_url = \"https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v1-beta/generation/text?version=2023-05-28\"\n        Headers = {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + self.access_token,\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\n        }\n        data = {\n            \"model_id\": model_id,\n            \"input\": input,\n            \"parameters\": parameters,\n            \"project_id\": self.project_id\n        }\n        response = requests.post(wml_url, json=data, headers=Headers)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return response.json()[\"results\"][0][\"generated_text\"]\n        else:\n            return response.text","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## watsonx API connection\nThis cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation\nModel inferencing.\n\n**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud personal API key.
